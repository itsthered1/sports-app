# sports-app
A score-fetching app for Pebble smartwatches. 

This is currently a side-project, worked on whenever I have free time or am out of school. Because of this, there is no definitive timeline. If you wish to contribute, feel free to do so! I will not be providing any builds or .pbws, since I am constantly making changes. If you would like to use the watchapp, please build it yourself.
